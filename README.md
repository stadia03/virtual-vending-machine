# virtual-vending-machine

First of all, am grateful that you landed upon my repo among thousands of creations.

So basically, I created a simple UI for a vending machine using C language, used some function calls and combined with file handling to save the record data and passwords.

Here are functions listed down.

YOU CAN GO THROUGH COMMENTS FOR BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CODE : )

Now letâ€™s take look into interesting feature, thatâ€™s the admin login.

Here first it asks for password, that is saved into your file so it canâ€™t be changed directly.

Now it feels like the superuser hahh, having the rights to reset things, change password or check for the stats.

Letâ€™s try to change the password.

Please copy the code and twitch with the functions, maybe the labels or you can build upon it, and feel free to contact me, I will be more than happy to work with you.

Thatâ€™s it, my mini-DIY project. Hope you like it ðŸ˜Š.
